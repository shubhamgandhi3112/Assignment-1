4. Canvas and SVG tags



Ans. : 

canvas : The <canvas> element provides a drawing surface on which you can use JavaScript to draw graphics dynamically. It is a bitmap-based rendering solution, meaning that you work with pixels directly. The canvas element requires scripting to generate graphics and animations.


svg : The <svg> element is used to embed scalable vector graphics directly in an HTML document. SVG is a markup language for describing two-dimensional vector graphics. Unlike the <canvas>, SVG images are resolution-independent and can be scaled up or down without losing quality.
